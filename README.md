## Purpose

The purpose of this Portfolio was to create a website that not only provides information about myself, my interests and my work experience, but also highlights my proffesional knowledge, talent and abilities.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this portfolio is employers looking to engage a Software Developer. As a result, it is hoped that my Portfolio is able to highlight neccesary information with professionalism, while also allowing any prospective employers to easily get in contact, if they like what they see.

### Tech Stack

The tech stack used for the creation of this portfolio was HTML and CSS.  HTML was utilised to create the basic structure of the websites and each page within it; and CSS was utilised to style each of the pages in order to meet the goal of the website.

Additionally, Figma was used twice during the planning stages of the Portfolio. 

1. Firstly, to create wireframes of each intended HTML pages, and how they should each look on different screen sizes. 
2. To create a sitemap of all the pages on the website

Finally, GitHub was used for source control throughout the entire project.

## Sitemap

![Sitemap of Portfolio Pages](docs/sitemap.png)
<!-- Explain the overall structure of the website and how different pages will be navigated -->
As you can see from the sitemap above, the Portfolio has a homepage and 4 additional pages. Each of these four pages can be accessed by clicking a link on the hompage (represented above as the black lines). Likewise, the homepage can be accessed through each of the 4 pages by clicking a link on each of the 4 pages (also represented through the black lines). Additionally, each of the 4 HTML pages can be accessed by clicking a link on the Nav bar that is located on each page. This can be seen on the sitemap above, as each HTML page has 3 red lines running into it, meaning it can be accessed by any of the other 3 pages. Overall, both the black and red lines represent the Nav Bar that is uniform accross all of the pages. I chose to make the Nav Bar availble on all of the pages to ensure easy movement from page to page in addition to allowing the viewers to go back and forth between pages if desired. All of these links (when clicked) open up in the current page. This was preferable over opening each page in a new tab as it allos for a more seamless and cohesive viewing of the Portfolio.

It can also be seen from the sitemap above, that each page (homepage + 4 pages) has 3 contact links (to Email, Linkdin and Github) which can be observed above as the green circles. These represent the links provided in the footer of each document. I chose to put these 3 links in the footer (and therefore have them available on each page) as the target audience for this Portfolio is prospective employers and therefore, I wanted to make sure they have easy access to contact me from any page. All of these links (when clicked) open up in new tabs instead of opening in the current page as it is intended that these links provide additional information/contact opportunities without intterupting their ability to view the rest of the Portfolio.

The Homepage has 2 additional links that take the viewer to my professional accounts, Linkdin and GitHub (can be seen above in the pink circles). Although these links can already be accessed through the footer of this page, they add to the simplistic styling of the homepage (that will be explained in further detail below) in addition to driving home the message that this is a proffessional Portfolio. 

It can also be seen from the sitemap above that there is a link to the Blog page on the About Me page. This is because snippets from the blog page are highlighted in the About Me page, and as a result, I wanted the viewer to have easy access to the blog page (which provides more information) from the about me page.

Finally, it can be seen in the sitemap above that there is an external link to a PDF copy of my Resume that can be accessed from the Resume page. This was an aesthetic decision that will be explained in further detail below, but ultimately allows quick access to a PDF copy of my resume without it taking up space on the webpage. Again, since the target audience of this Portfolio is prospective employers, this link opens up in a new tab so that they have the option to read it in futher detail after exploring the rest of my Portfoloio.

### Decision Making Process of the Homepage

For the homepage, I wanted this do be as minimal as possible. My decision behind this was that I wanted my name to stand out and not have too much visual clutter surrounding it, so that it would stand out to the employer and hopefully make an impact. As a result, The hero unit included my name only and a very brief description of 'Aspiring Developer' getting the message across that that is my intention for the creation of this website. Additionally, I decided to include 2 icons that linked to my professional accounts (GitHub and LinkedIn), again to really drive home the message that this website is to show that I am an Aspiring Developer, willing to be contacted by potential employers. 

The styling for the homepage was used to enhance the simplistic and proffesional look I was after. A black background with white writing was chosen for the homepage only to make more of an impact than the other pages. A simple font was chosen that can be easily read and it was centered for maximum impact and readability. Additionally, only a very minimal number of colours are used throughout the entire website to continue the professional feel. I did keep the LinkedIn icon blue as it does provide some relief of the black and white homepage, in addition to drawing the viewers attention to click the icon which will take them to my professional account.

The Nav Bar is consistent accross all pages as I wanted it to be a seamless experience for the viewer.It consists of a Logo of my initials, which again I created with simplicity and professionalism in mind, in addition to links to the other 4 HTML pages, which are evenly spaced out for clear reading. In terms of colours, I kept the theme of black and white consitent across all pages so that it remains seamless, clean and ultimately soes not take away from the content on the main page. The Nav Bar was styled with pseudo elements so that when the viewer hovers over each page label, it is underlined light green so that they know which they will be directed to if they click. Initally, I had the background of the label go completely green, however, I changed it so that it is just underlined green, as I thought it better maintained my goal of a professional website.

Additionally, the footer is made up of 4 elements including links to my email, GitHub and Linkedin and a copyright tag. Again, thegoalwas to make thisprofessionaland simple so that Icanultimatelybe contacted by a prospective employer with ease. By having these links in the footer (across all pages), a prospective employer willbe abletocontact me no matter what page they are on. As stated previously, these links arestyled so that they will open up the links to my professional accounts in a new tab, ratherthan the same window, so that the employer can refer back to the website if required. For these icons, I kept them black and white so that they did not take away from the more important content in the main section of the page. Finally, I decided to align the contents of the footer in the center (which is different from my original wireframe) as I found it was all too spaced out and did not look as professional and as easy to access as laid out in the wireframe.

As all pages across this website, the homepage is designed and styled with responsiveness in mind. The main difference across the different viewports is the stacking of my name/hero element. Instead of keeping my name in one line, if the employer is viewing my portfolio on a tablet or a phone, it will stack my name to ensure it remains the highlight of the page. If it were toremainas one line, it would have to becometoo small to make an impact.
